A publicly available web-based tool to simplify the process of identification and categorization of cosmic ray artifacts. The tool will allow the user to choose an image or a group of images, and the program will highlight all the cosmic ray artifacts in the images, provide cropped portions of the artifacts, and classify them. Additionally, the user may select from a list of existing archives to view the day-wise statistics pertaining to the cosmic ray phenomenon. The purpose of this tool is to cater to the needs of planetary scientists and researchers with minimal knowledge of Machine Learning techniques.
